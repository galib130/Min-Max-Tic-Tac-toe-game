# Min-Max-Tic-Tac-toe-game

Min-Max is an AI algorithm which allows a system to estimate the next best move in a game or in a situation 
This is achieved by the system by evaluating possible legal moves available and choosing the move which maximizes the reward for the system.

I used this min-max algorithm to create a tic tac toe game which is unbeatable. Based on user moves the system decides what moves to make next.

There are three modes to this game.

The beginner mode allows user to play against the system with the system making random moves against the user. It's fairly straightforward to beat the system

The multiplayer mode allows multiple players to play on the same browser

In the unbeatable mode the user can try to win the game, but so far the best outcome for the user is a tie.

Prompts are used to create initials

game can be played on an app too.

Background music is used when making moves or after a game is finished

Css animation used for background

Game is hosted on github pages.
